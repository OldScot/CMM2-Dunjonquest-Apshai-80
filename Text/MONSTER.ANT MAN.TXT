AntMen
These creatures look like six foor long ants walking
upright on their hindmost legs with the other four legs
free for manipulation. There are significant differences
between the classes of antmen but unfortunately these
differences are only discernible to other antmen. They
attack with their mandibles and sometimes with their 
forelegs as well.
