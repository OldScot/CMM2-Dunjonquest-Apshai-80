Level 1 - Room Thirty
The smoothly carved northern and southern sections
of the chamber contrast sharply with the native
granite found in the middle of the room, suggesting
that is has been widened out from a natural
passage. A quiver and some arrows lie on the floor
in the middle of the chamber next to a sword and a
broken bow.
