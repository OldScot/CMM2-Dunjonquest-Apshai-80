Level 2 - Room One
Is a passage with native granite walls. The ceiling
and floor have been carved level. A low scraping sound
vibrates through the floor. The air has the musty smell
of age and death. The dust on the floor is heavy near
the walls, but a clear path has been worn down the
center of the passage.
