Level 3 - Room Forty-four
Is a huge natural cavern with a leveled floor,
although a few stalactites hang from the roof. The
opening to the north has been dug through the rock.
A heap of stones stands in the middle of the cavern.
There is a faint draft of air blowing from north to
south through the cavern.
