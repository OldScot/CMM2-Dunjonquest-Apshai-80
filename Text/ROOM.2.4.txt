Level 2 - Room Four
The east wall is of cut and worked stone. The
brass-bound wooden doors in the north and south walls
are secured by rusty iron locks. The tracks of small
animals crisscross the floor between the doors and
the air smells of musk and rot. The sound of flowing
water can be heard through the floor and a low 
rumbling can be heard in the east end of the passage.
