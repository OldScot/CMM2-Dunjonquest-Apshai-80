Level 4 - Room Twenty-four
Is a long narrow room with wooden doors at either end.
The walls are covered with arcane heiroglyphs and
tapestries bearing the same glyphs hang beside the
doors. The room looks often-used and the air smells
heavily of vanilla. There are many wooden cots with
tattered mattresses in the room. A large chest
occupies the northwest corner of the room.
