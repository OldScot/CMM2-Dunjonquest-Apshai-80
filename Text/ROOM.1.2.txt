A stream runs through this natural stone chamber.
A narrow landing adjacent to the corridor at the
north end of the chamber allows easy access to the
stream. The water flows in from a cut in the west
wall and flows out under the north wall near the
landing. In an alcove near one end of the landing
there are many urns and pots.  The water is very
clear and appears to be about three feet deep.
