Level 4 - Room Fifty-five
Is a passage with stonework on the south and east walls
and the other walls, floor, and ceiling of carved rock.
The upper portion of the corridor is sheathed in cobwebs
and a larger web fills the south end of the passage. A
small sack lies near the west wall partway down the
corridor, silver pieces spilling from its mouth.
