Level 1 - Room Fifteen
Is an irregular cave of native rock. The walls and
floor are covered with a heavy matting of multi-hued
moss. The walls are brilliant reds, greens, and blues,
while the floor is a pastel yellow. A wooden box lies
topless in the middle of the cavern floor. Inside lies
a well-made cloak. The material of the cloak seems to
shimmer in the torchlight.
