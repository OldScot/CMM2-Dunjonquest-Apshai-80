Level 2 - Room Twenty-three
Strange implements litter a table in the center of
the room. Here and there are various cages with the
remains of animals. Jars filled with a viscous
liquid and holding a miscellany of body parts from
assorted creatures are stored in racks on the north
wall. The door to the east is made of wood and is
secured with a rusty iron bolt.
