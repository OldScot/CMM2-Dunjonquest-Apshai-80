Level 4 - Room Twenty
Is a small room that appears to be a natural cave except
for the west and north walls. A large chest stands open
in the southeast comer of the room. The west wall is
covered with soot as is the western part of the ceiling.
Bones are scattered over the dusty floor and the air
carries a strange sickly sweet odor. From the chest
comes the gleam of jewelry and gold.
