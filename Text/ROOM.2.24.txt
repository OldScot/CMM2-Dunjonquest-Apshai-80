Level 2 - Room Twenty-four
A desk sits against the north wall and a table and
chair against the south wall. Along the east wall
is a bed with a chest visible beneath it. The floor
is covered with an unbroken layer of dust. The sound
of flowing water can be heard from an opening in the
northeast corner where a stream flows beneath the
flooring.
