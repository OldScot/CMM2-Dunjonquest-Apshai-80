Level 2 - Room Twenty
Leather hangings on the west wall cover a doorway. The
room is littered with sawdust and rusty woodworking
tools. A metal shaft runs from floor to ceiling in the
southwest corner, attached to a large sawblade by a
complex system of gears and levers, all rusty from age
and disuse. The scraping sound is now very loud. If you
move one of the levers, it will cause a loud screeching
beneath the floor.
