Level 1 - Room Fifty-six
Is a passage with rough stone walls and floor and
a native granite ceiling. The south wall of the
passage is faced with smooth squarish stones near
the far end, while the floor and other walls are
of a rough stone. A foul, musty odor fills the
air and a thin layer of moss coats the floor at
the extreme end of the passage.
