Ghouls
Are misshapen creatures with longer than normal arms,
wicked claws, and a mouthful of razor sharp fangs
which they ably employ to crack the bones of their
prey.  They have tough hide and stand about seven feet
tall.  They are said to eat the soul of their prey as
it exits the dying body.
