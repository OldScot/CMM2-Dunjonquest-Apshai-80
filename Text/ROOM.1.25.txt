A stagnant pond fills the south end of the carved
stone chamber, with a narrow landing at the south
end. White mold covers the surface of the water,
save the southeast corner, where a gold-colored
seaweed is in evidence. Tests will reveal the
water to be three feet deep, but the bottom of
the pool cannot be seen through the murk.
