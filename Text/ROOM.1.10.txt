Level 1 - Room Ten
The air of the room is filled with a cloying, sweet
aroma, causing the senses to reel. The walls of the
room are covered with moss which is largely brown and
dried with only a few pale green patches remaining.
Breaking off any part of the green moss will reveal
it as the source of the aroma.
