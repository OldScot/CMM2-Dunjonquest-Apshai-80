Level 4 - Room Forty-six
Is a passage with stonework on the west wall and the
other walls, floor and ceiling of carved rock. The
dusty floor shows a faint trail running the length of
the corridor along the west wall and a hint of vanilla
is in the air. A discarded backpack rests against the
east wall in the north end of the passage.
