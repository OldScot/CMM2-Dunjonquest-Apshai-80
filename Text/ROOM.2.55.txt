Is a large natural cavern, except for the western
portion of the south wall, which is stonework. A
large waterfall plummets from the ceiling to a pool
in the rear of the cavern, blanketing the area in
mist. The chamber reverberates with the roar of the
cataract. Lying near the bank of the pond is a
moss-covered sack. The air is filled with the fresh
scent of the many mosses and ferns growing about.
