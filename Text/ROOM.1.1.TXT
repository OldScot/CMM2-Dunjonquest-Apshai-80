Level 1 - Room One
The smooth stonework of the passageway floor shows
that advanced methods were used in its creation. A
skeleton sprawls on the floor just inside the door,
a bony hand, still clutching a rusty dagger,
outstretched toward the door to safety. A faint
roaring sound can be heard from the far end of the
passage.
