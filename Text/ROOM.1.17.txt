Level 1 - Room Seventeen
Only the floor has been smoothed in this chamber, the
walls and ceiling having been left in the natural state.
The air smells of decaying vegetable matter. A small
mound of stones against the west wall in the north end
of the passage partially blocks the way to the north.
