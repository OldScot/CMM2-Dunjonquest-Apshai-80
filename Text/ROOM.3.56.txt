Level 3 - Room Fifty-six
Is a natural cave. The opening to the north has been
dug through the earth without the benefit of tools.
The walls show the marks of recent digging. The air
smells heavily of vanilla. A small basket holding a
few gold nuggets sits on the floor in the southeast
corner.
