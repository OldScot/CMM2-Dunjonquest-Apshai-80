Level 4 - Room Thirty-two
Is a long room with the ceiling and upper parts of
the walls covered with a heavy layer of soot. Three
large stone ovens line the north wall and a long
grill occupies the eastern half of the south wall.
The dusty floor shows the tracks of large animals
and the air reeks of musk.
