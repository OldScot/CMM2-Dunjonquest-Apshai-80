Level 3 - CAVE IN TRAP

There are no traps per se in the Apshaian mines.
One never knows, however, when a rock might loose
itself and cause severe damage to those unfortunate
enough to be standing below. For this reason it is
highly recommended that all visitors wear helmets
while wandering through the ancient caverns.
