Level 2 - Room Two
The walls of the tunnel have been smoothed and widened
with carving tools. A brass-bound wooden door is set
into the north wall near the west end of the passage,
its broken lock hanging from the corroded hasp. The
scraping sound continues. The dusty path continues
straight for a way, then disappears into a side
passage to the south.
