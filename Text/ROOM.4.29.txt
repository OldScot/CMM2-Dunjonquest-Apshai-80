Level 4 - Room Twenty-nine
Is a smallish room furnished only with rotting
cushions strewn about the floor. Tattered tapestries
hang on the east and west wails showing scenes of
obscene and bloody sacrifice before a mantis shaped
god. A shiny object protrudes from beneath one of
the cushions near the center of the room.
