Level 4 - Room Thirty-eight
The floor of the room is covered with the remains of
straw mats. A variety of pieces of martial equipment
litter the mats along the walls. In the northeast
corner, a bony elbow pokes through a rent in a suit of
rusty chainmail. A gnawed thighbone lies near the door.
