Wraiths
These ghostly creatures appear as skeletal figures
garbed in hooded frocks.  Their eyes are fiery
points of light within their cowls. They move
effortlessly about leaving no trace of their passing
and are capable of passing through solid matter at
will.  Many have died under the chill touch of their
bony hands.
