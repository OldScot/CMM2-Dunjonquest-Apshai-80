Level 4 - Room Nineteen
Is a large room with the south wall of carved rock.
The room is austerely furnished with wooden planks
hanging from chains on the east, west, and south
walls. The floor is covered with mouldering straw
and the air reeks of decay and vanilla. A dead rat
lies in the center of the floor.
