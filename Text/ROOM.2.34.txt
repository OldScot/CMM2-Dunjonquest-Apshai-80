Level 2 - Room Thirty-four
A table and four chairs sit in the middle of the room
and two goblets lie on the floor nearby. Footprints
crisscross the dusty floor. The wooden door to the
north stands ajar. The eastern door is wooden with
iron hinges and has a small barred window at eye level.
A low rumbling sound is audible from the west.
