Level 2 - Room Thirty-eight
Is a large natural cavern. Manacles hang from the
north wall, one set still supporting a human
skeleton. Various braziers, irons, and larger
implements of torture line the east and south walls.
The air is musty and the moaning and clanking
continues though no source is evident.
