Level 1 - Room Twenty-one
The west wall of the cavern shows the marks of carving
tools, but the rest is natural rock. The floor of the
room is overgrown with mushrooms of two varieties.
One has broad, flat caps and is white with brown
splotches, while the second variety has black, tightly
rounded caps.
