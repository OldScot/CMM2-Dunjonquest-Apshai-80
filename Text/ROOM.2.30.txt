Level 2 - Room Thirty
Is a large cavern with stonework on the west wall and
the western half of the south wall. Bales, casks, and
crates line the walls and the shelves in the middle
of the room. The air smells of musk and rot, and the
tracks of small animals abound. Water can be heard
flowing beneath the floor.
