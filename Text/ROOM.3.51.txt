Level 3 - Room Fifty-one
Is a small excavated chamber. A well-worn path runs
between the north and west openings with a fainter
trail to the east. The air smells faintly of vanilla
intermingled with the odor of decayed flesh. A newly
slain antman lies in the southwest corner with a
spilled basket of gold nuggets nearby.
