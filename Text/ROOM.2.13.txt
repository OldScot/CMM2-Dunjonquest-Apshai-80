Level 2 - Room Thirteen
All four walls are covered with a heavy layer of
soot. Rusty tools and scrap iron litter the floor,
several weapons in various states of repair among
them. A large forge against the north wall shows
no signs of recent use. The dirty floor is covered
with a black, grimy dust.
