Level 1 - Room Five
Is a pond-filled room with a small landing to the
south. The surface of the sluggish water is covered
with moss and a number of black lilies rest
peacefully upon the green matting. The water can be
found to be about three feet deep and flows almost
imperceptibly in under the west wall and out under
the east wall. Some of the lilies can be reached
from the landing.
