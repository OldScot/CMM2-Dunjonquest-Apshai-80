Level 4 - Room Forty-nine
Is a passage with stonework on the south wall and the
other wall, floor and ceiling of carved rock. A faint
path on the dusty floor leads along the south wall and
the air smells slightly of vanilla. A broken bow and
an empty quiver rest against the north wall halfway
down the passage.
