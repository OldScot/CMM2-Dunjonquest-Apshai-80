Level 3 - Room Forty-three
Is a natural cave. The openings to the south and east
have been dug through the earth but show no toolmarks.
The floor is much travelled and the walls show signs
of recent digging. A small basket in the southwest
corner holds a few gold nuggets. The air is thick with
the smell of vanilla.
